# SoftwareStructure

There are two main programs here:
  PasswordHasher.java, password_hasher.py

Both of the programs give the same result:
They take a JSON array from a file calle "j.json" and create a JSON object to a file called "users.json", where this file has a list of the users with their hashed password (by JAVA string-hash algorithm)

There is a (pretty) coherent graph which presents the runtime, of 10 tests, of both of the programs.
There is a program called py_jav_stats.py which generate the graph.

The information that the graph uses lies in the text files "Runtime results - python.txt" and "Runtime results - JAVA.txt".

There is a UML of the JAVA project, which is a very simple one-class UML.

A comparison document can be found, with a lot of details regarding the two programs.

Thank you for reading!
